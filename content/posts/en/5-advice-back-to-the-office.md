June will be decisive. the return to normal life is looming (finally). following government announcements, ** teleworking will become more flexible ** as of June 9. this change implies the ** return to the office of all or part of your employees **. also many questions arise such as the interest of returning to the office after the social bond has weakened.

here are our ** 5 tips ** to best prepare the return of your human capital on site:

## ** 1. workplace experience **

** the office is dead. long live the workplace experience **. Following [our interview] (https://blog.refty.co/comment-se-modernise-la-fonction-rh/) with juliette parichet, hr business partner at voodoo, we decided to integrate this concept to our list. the organization of work has changed profoundly. ** digital tools ** (zoom, slack, microsoft teams, etc.) have ** increased their hold ** on organizations to enable them to maintain and develop their activities. The result is that the ** central position ** ** that the desk ** previously occupied ** ** in the work environment (both literally and figuratively) has gradually ** faded ** . ** why go back to the office if we are as much or more productive remotely? ** thorny question you will say. the workplace experience tries to answer it.

the office should no longer simply be a ** "place of work" ** but "a **" place of fulfillment and life ** ". it must be a ** catalyst for exchange, cohesion, well-being. ** the layout of offices, socialization spaces, extra-professional services (sport, relaxation area, etc.) are ** its instruments **. in essence, the office must respond to the ** quest for meaning and the need for experience **. returning to the office automatically involves promoting ** added value that differs from that which existed before **. it must enhance a distinctive and engaging atmosphere that does not exist anywhere else.

## ** 2. communicate on return to office **

some of your staff may be ** reluctant to return to the office **. for several reasons: fear of infecting their colleagues or relatives, loss of reference following the two confinements which upset their habits, social phobia ... some of them also had to design ** their own work experience ** at distance (management of time, place ...) and wish to ** keep it. **

communication, ** keystone ** of human relations, ** soothes the tensions and questions ** induced by returning to the office. struggling to develop an effective policy? you can get inspiration from ** onboarding **. when you welcome a recruit to your premises you send him (in theory) a ** roadmap ** which details his integration program, the various contacts with whom he will exchange, his schedule etc ... we invite you to ** transpose this process ** to all of your employees by adapting it to the return to the office. review the barrier gestures, the importance of wearing a mask, the rules of social distancing in the restaurant area…. above all, ** communicate ** before the fateful date on ** the contact points ** that you deem appropriate (email, video, telephone, slack, etc.). so that your message is heard and applied on d-day. get ahead of the game so you don't get overwhelmed by the lack of preparation and its repercussions. in short, adopt a ** proactive ** approach to ** simplify the experience ** of your colleagues and promote ** transparency **. is hybrid work possible? under what terms? for how long ?

## ** 3. co-define the “future of work” **

the year 2020 has reshaped the face of work. ** The rise of remote working ** has highlighted the need for the business to adapt quickly. ** the intensity ** and ** the duration ** of this practice produced several side effects. according to ilo the adverse effects are related to [** mental health and a feeling of isolation **] (https://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/wcms_748737 /lang--fr/index.htm). while the beneficial effects are in particular the increase in [** productivity **] (https://www.lefigaro.fr/conjoncture/le-teletravail-a-fait-grimper-la-productivite-des-salaries- de-22-20210315) ** and autonomy. **

however, teleworking is not just a simple ** polarization **. that's why measured words are called for. ** the social value ** of work has deteriorated. some people who are more productive at home than in the office, may not have worked as a team.

for an efficient return to the office, consult with employees to develop a more balanced and less fractured work policy. by collecting and using ** the ** ** feedback ** ** from each employee ** (whether they work remotely or face-to-face), it is very likely that you will better understand their perception of the work and the measures that must be maintained and abandoned. in this way, employees will feel considered and included in the decision-making process, which will strengthen their ** commitment **.

different modalities are available to you: half-remote, hybrid work, flex office….

However, organizations are at ** a crossroads. ** They have the opportunity to lay the foundations for the ** "future of work" ** now. or capitalize on what they were doing before. the direction they take will determine their ability to build an environment ** conducive to the productivity and development ** of every member of their community.

## ** 4. recreate social links **

** it withered but did not rupture **. social ties are one of the most important issues in this resumption of activity. Faced with ** social distancing and domestic isolation ** attributable to the health crisis, employees tried, as best they could, to maintain the cohesion they had forged in face-to-face. while the recruits who arrived along the way, they mainly integrated themselves via collaborative tools (slack, trello, etc.).

fragmented and diminished by a certain weariness, the community that was yours will have to:

• ** to ** ** re-mobilize around common values ​​** specific to your corporate culture and ** distinctive ** from those of your competitors to ** engage and retain ** your human capital

• ** galvanize its members ** around transversal projects that they will have to carry out together in order to ** strengthen cohesion and create a feeling of belonging. **

• ** unite and inspire ** its human capital through major events (offsite, business game, etc.)

• ** rebuild and develop ** an environment in which ** informal communication ** is expressed. the latter contributing to the dissemination of information and the sharing of knowledge.

this dimension is all the more important for some employees who may feel a certain ** demotivation ** at the idea of ​​returning to the office. they are no longer as efficient as they used to be, feel less inspired, question themselves due to the lack of interactions and support.

## ** 5. adjust everything. **

flexibility is also important here. like an iterative process, readjust your work policy in real time in order to face the various challenges it poses. use ** key performance indicators ** to assess ** their ** ** scope and depth. **

office layout is inefficient, redesign it. your roadmap is incomprehensible? clarify it. are your employees' feedback in favor of hybrid work? arbitrate and put in place the process that reconciles the development of your employees and the maintenance of social value (by explaining your approach)

## ** conclusion **

by applying our recommendations, you will have a broader vision (hopefully) of the issues surrounding returning to the office. and you will be able to respond to your human capital in a ** proportionate and efficient manner. **

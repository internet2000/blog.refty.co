A recruitment error is expensive: it is estimated at 45kâ‚¬ (source: [HR-Voice](https://www.hr-voice.com/recrutement/recrutement-rate-quel-est-le-cout-pour-lentreprise/2019/02/11/#:\~:text=Le%20co%C3%BBt%20d'un%20recrutement,la%20r%C3%A9mun%C3%A9ration%20de%20celui%2Dci.&text=Lorsque%20l'entreprise%20fait%20appel,annuel%20brut%20du%20candidat%20embauch%C3%A9.))

In the current period, companies will limit their recruitments. It will be essential to recruit only the most competent people for the positions sought.

Taking references is a practice that tends to become widespread to secure recruitment.

In most cases, it is the last step before validating a job offer, like an additional safety net.

At Refty, we interviewed more than 60 HR and recruitment professionals. The majority of those interviewed recognize that the value of this practice is limited.

Why such a disavowal of this practice, despite being recommended by recruitment specialists (see: [Marc Laurent Blog article](https://medium.com/@mrclrnt/part-6-taking-up-genuine-references-79b57dc4cf2e) ðŸ¤—)?

ðŸ‘‰Because taking references as it is practiced in most cases, has its share of biases and imperfections.

We explain why.

## A doubly biased process

* First, on the candidate's side, since he or she has to give his or her consent on the referents to be contacted (it's a legal obligation!). It is very likely that the people he/she chooses - his/her referees - will leave a positive opinion of the collaboration with him/her.
* On the recruiting company's side: references are usually requested at the end of the process. The people involved in the recruitment process will tend to want to confirm the idea (good or bad) they have of the candidate throughout the process. This is a confirmation bias.

## Random relevance of the information collected

Taking references over the phone depends mainly on the expertise of the person who does it.

Does he or she know how to ask the right questions? Will he/she challenge the referrer sufficiently?

The quality of the answers will also depend on the involvement of the person answering the questions.

> Uncertainty about how the exercise will be conducted inevitably leads to an imperfect information collection, the quality of which can vary greatly.

## A poorly exploited value

1- When taking references, each evaluator will try to collect information that seems useful for his or her situation and needs.

2- The non-standardization of answers can lead to a [disparate structure](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alineholzwarth/2021/02/18/how-to-actually-hire-for-diversity/?sh=794a46b246f9) that is sometimes difficult to use by the other people involved.

â†’ The value of the references collected then becomes very relative.

> Moreover, all the actions devoted by the assessor to taking references have little added value for the person who has to carry them out: **i)** asking the candidate for the referents, **ii)** contacting the referents, **iii)** following up with them, **iv)** agreeing on a time slot **v)** taking the references over the phone, **vi)** noting them down in his recruitment software, **vii)** transferring them to the decision-makers / manager.

## Refty is rethinking the entire value chain of collecting external information about a candidate.

* A redesigned experience

After interviewing 3 human resources psychologists and more than 60 industry players, we were able to establish an objective data collection form focused on the candidate's behavior (the famous soft skills!)

The Refty tool allows the manager to request up to 6 references per candidate in a few clicks.

They can then monitor the progress of all the references collected from a dashboard.

Within 72 hours, a summary of the references taken is available on the manager's space.

* The use of this tool has three main purposes:

Identify and recruit A-players {[https://whothebook.com/](https://whothebook.com/ "https://whothebook.com/")} (and mechanically avoid bad recruitments),

To save time in the recruitment process and to let only the best candidates through,

Facilitate the integration of the candidate thanks to the information collected.

**"Employability"** is the ability to be recruited.

**"Soft-skills"** can be defined as anything that encompasses an individual and that is not seen on a CV, diploma, or Linkedin profile.

> The soft-skills determine our personality, our motivations, and our preferred behaviors in the professional environment.

A person is recruited for what she knows, what she can do, but also and above all for who she is, how he behaves. There is a notion of projection in time to be taken into account, a kind of bet on the future.

Taking soft skills into account will reduce uncertainty in this risk-taking.

## 🙋🏻‍♂️The use of soft-skills on the **candidate side**

* How to identify your soft-skills as an individual?

In the professional context, it is about determining what each one can do and how he does it.

There are several ways to find out about your soft-skills:

* **Introspection: self-reflection**


* Highlighting one's strengths and areas for improvement: retrospectively determining what was done, what was lacking in a given mission/job to enable me to outperform and, conversely, the conditions that enabled me to achieve the set objectives,
* Deduce soft-skills by analyzing your behavior in "basic" situations: how to work in a team, how to communicate...etc,
* Avoid devaluing yourself: stay as honest and objective as possible.

* **Via a Questionnaire:**

These questionnaires work on personality traits or types. Measuring trends or levels, the results should always be analyzed.

Some examples of tests: PAPI, MBTI, SOSIE, Assessfirst, Talentoday, PerformanSe...

The science regularly used in these tests is psychometry. A serious test must meet psychometric qualities: stability, reliability, fidelity, validity. Even be recognized by institutions: ITC...

* **Via Coaching**

There is a cost to hiring a coach, and it is often complicated to use this service in companies. Nevertheless, coaches will often give pertinent analyses on the personality of each person.

For students, there are often career counsellors who are increasingly trained in psychometrics. Do not hesitate to ask them for help!

* **By using references / feedback from people with whom you have collaborated**

The art of 360° feedback is good for getting to know each other better!

Asking former colleagues, teachers what they think about our behaviours, what we can improve, what they find interesting, what we need to work on.... all this can be interesting feedback. They can have an objective view of our behaviours.

* How to promote your soft-skills according to a job offer?

100% of jobs require soft-skills!

It is important to keep in mind that recruiters who take soft skills into account in their recruitment process - interview or assessment - do so to get the best possible idea of the candidate's development in the position and that they will also analyze your personality, the personality of the team you will be joining as well as the company's culture.

As a candidate, you will have to put forward the skills you are expected to have in full knowledge of the facts!

To get an idea of the expected soft-skills: 

* Read the job offer carefully, it is regularly full of interesting information: team, role...
* To get in-depth information about the company and the proposed missions: company culture, employee profiles, etc.
* Ask the recruiter questions about the company, its evolution - projection of the post.

The soft-skills are the result of experience and life experience. To highlight them, it is, therefore, necessary to recount work situations in which these soft skills have been a lever for success.

It is important to keep in mind the personality traits and motivations that will enable you to get the job you are looking for.

* How to work on your soft-skills?

Your personality comes from your education, your experience, your encounters.

A part of your personality is therefore irremovable. But a part can develop and evolve according to external or internal factors.

According to various studies, notable changes in personality traits are visible approximately every 4-6 months.

To work and develop your soft skills, you need to be open to yourself an others so that you always have a precise knowledge of yourself.

* There is no exact science, no method, no calculation of the human relationship.
* It is necessary to be interested in people, to be curious, empathetic...
* Do not hesitate to take a personality questionnaire regularly or to repeat the introspection and feedback exercise, with the help of coaching.
* Advice to a candidate who would like to integrate the soft-skills in the preparation of an interview or his CV:

Contextualize: if this work is not done, it will lack materiality and the allusion to soft-skills will remain declarative. On the other hand, if work situations are evoked that show and demonstrate these qualities, then it will make sense.

The same applies to motivations. Professional motivations can be varied: remuneration, usefulness, the need to belong to society, etc.

Without having to force yourself, it is necessary to prepare a speech and a story that allows you to identify these motivations!

Don't hesitate to submit the results of personality tests to your recruiters, HR, or psychologists.

> Candidates must be seduced as much as they must seduce the recruiter. There is no subordination recruiter / recruited - it's a match!
>
> The soft-skills will allow them to identify the good and very good ones and allow them to recruit the top profiles.

## 🧐 The use of soft-skills on the **recruiting side**

* How to bring out the soft-skills and make the candidate reveal himself?

As a recruiter, soft-skills will help you make decisions, make good choices, and reduce areas of uncertainty and chance.

It is therefore important to succeed in capturing soft skills in candidates.

There are several ways to do this:

* **Questioning/observing in interviews**

\- Ask him about the reactions he has had to specific situations that await him in the company: management, organization... or ask him how he would react if different events occur: crisis, changes, integration of a new employee, etc...

\- Ask questions where the candidate will have to make choices and position himself. He or she will guide his or her behavior and will prove to be a diplomat, an animator, a persevering person, showing self-confidence and respect for the hierarchy.

\- Measures his stress, his risk aversion, his ability to make decisions, to communicate, and identify the way he will do it.

* **Test**

Integrate a personality test of good level and with a good candidate experience. Or observe the way the candidate behaves in a group to capture his behaviors & positioning.

* **Use a system of references/recommendations**

Favor an innovative approach to promote objectivity based on soft-skills.

These exercises are personality revealing and will help to better project the candidate into the environment of the position, the team, and the company in the short and medium-term.

This notion of temporality is important because soft skills are living, evolving skills; they are part of a continuum and can change over time.

The recruitment process must be adapted to these new needs for capturing and exploiting soft-skills.

> The soft-skills sought in a different candidate according to the position, sector, level, seniority... but also according to the company: culture, maturity, environment.

* How to project a candidate into a team thanks to soft-skills?

High-performing team = complementary personalities and common motivations. A recruiter needs to establish a projection of the degree of suitability of a candidate concerning a manager or a team. Or even more globally in the organization.

Concretely, it would be necessary to :

* Imagine an immersion during the recruitment process,
* Map the skills of the future team and compare them with the candidate's soft-skills,
* Compare achievements to measure adequacy.

This will make it easier for the recruiter to recommend candidates to managers.

* How can Soft-skills be used for onboarding and candidate development in the company?

Soft-skills must be taken into consideration during the recruitment and cultivated throughout a career. The difference with hard-skills is mainly at this level.

Soft-skills analysis provides unique information to harmoniously integrate new employees into teams and facilitate employee development plans: career path, internal mobility, training.

> Soft-skills must be taken into account as part of a global skills approach. It complements the more traditional analysis of know-how.

Soft-skills analysis is part of the new paradigm, of an innovative and evolving HR culture.

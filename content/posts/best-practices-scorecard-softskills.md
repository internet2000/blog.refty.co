## Soft skills, everyone is talking about it, the Score Card job, a lot of people are talking about it.

It seemed interesting to us to mix the two and to understand how recruiting companies manage the Soft Skills Score Card.  
  
More than 15 HR from tech/innovative companies told us their recipe (Voodoo, Qonto...etc). We have synthesized them into 5 steps that can be quickly implemented.

* **Step 1: Establish the key values inherent in the company's culture**

To have determined precisely what is the culture of the company → to bring out concretely the values that will be common to all the members who will join the company.

Ideally, the number of these values should not exceed 4.

_"The idea is not to have clones but people who reflect our corporate culture"._

* **Step 2: Making the Persona 0**

In collaboration with the manager of each team establish a mapping of the expected soft skills for each position.

In a priori, we will expect different soft skills from a salesperson than from a developer.

We will also take into account:

The expected soft skills that will best match the management in place.

As well as the type(s) of behavior that will easily blend in with the existing team members.

* **Step 3 : Writing the Scorecard**

The defined soft skills are collected in a scorecard (where the hard skills sought for the position in question are also listed).

Two columns are left empty next to each soft skill:

\- one column will be used to rate out of 5 the result obtained by the candidate.

\- one column will be used to record any comments

The Notion tool seems to be perfectly adapted (65% of respondents)

* **Step 4: Interviews**

During the interviews, for a soft skill to be considered as validated/acquired by the candidate, it must be followed by a concrete example.

_"Clearly, at each step make sure you get precise feedback on each of the dimensions to make sure you have chosen THE right person at the end."_

* **Step 5: Reporting**

In terms of reporting, a scorecard is a standardization tool that has been unanimously acclaimed in that it allows the responses to be cross-referenced and compared.

All of the stakeholders interviewed (HR, Managers, CEO, etc.) are in favor of this methodology because of the objectivity it implies in the recruitment process, particularly in terms of soft skills analysis.
